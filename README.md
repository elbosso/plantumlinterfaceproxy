This project acts as a backend for the [gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) [plantuml](https://plantuml.com/) [integration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/integration/plantuml.html):

## Backends

### PlantUML

It can be used as a standin for any [Plantuml](https://plantuml.com) server and - as far as plantuml is concerned - it is completely 
transparent. If the user configures the _environment.env_ in such a way that the properties point to a plantuml server all
that functionality still works as it has before.

So for example the following fragment (enclosed in lines containing ` ```plantuml ` and ` ``` `) would be replaced with a rendering of the diagram specified in it:

```
Alice->Bob: hello1
Alice->Bob: hello3
```
### TeX

Now the user has more options: if the first line of the plantuml script is *`%TeX`*, the remaining content of that script is interpreted
as a mathematical formula set with TeX and an image is created from it that then appears instead of the script as with plantuml diagrams. 
An example would be the following fragment (again - enclosed in lines containing ` ```plantuml ` and ` ``` `):

```
%TeX
x^n + y^n = z^n
```

It is optionally possible to specify equation numbers: if a number is given
after `%TeX`, the successor if that number is rendered as that equations
number and can be used as label for references in the surrounding text. An
Example where *8* would be rendered as equation label is:

```
%TeX 7
a+b = c
```

*Please be aware that TeX is Turing complete (https://elbosso.github.io/tex_virus.html#content) and therefore can pose a security threat (https://elbosso.github.io/resources/tex-login.pdf) - Use this image at your own discretion. It is probably best to self-host it and only allow users you know and trust!*

### WireViz

If the first line of the script is *`wireviz`* then the remainder of the script is sent on to a [WireViz](https://github.com/formatc1702/WireViz) renderer. This renderer produces and
image and that image is returned to gitlab, replacing the script. An example for this functionality might be the following fragment (enclosed in lines containing ` ```plantuml ` and ` ``` `):

```
#wireviz
connectors:
  X1:
    type: D-Sub
    subtype: female
    pinout: [DCD, RX, TX, DTR, GND, DSR, RTS, CTS, RI]
  X2:
    type: Molex KK 254
    subtype: female
    pinout: [GND, RX, TX]

cables:
  W1:
    gauge: 0.25 mm2
    length: 0.2
    color_code: DIN
    wirecount: 3
    shield: true

connections:
  -
    - X1: [5,2,3]
    - W1: [1,2,3]
    - X2: [1,3,2]
  -
    - X1: 5
    - W1: s
```

### Gnuplot

If the first line of the script starts with *`#gnuplot`* followed by at least one whitespace and a dimension specification in the form of `widthxheight` for example `800x600` then the remainder of the script is processed by [Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/). This produces a rendering of the contents of the script - the image produced has the dimensions given after `#gnuplot`. This image is returned to Gitlab, replacing the script. An example for this functionality might be the following fragment (enclosed in lines containing ` ```plantuml ` and ` ``` `):

```

*Please be aware that Gnuplot can execute arbitrary shell commands and therefore can pose a security threat - Use this image at your own discretion. It is probably best to self-host it and only allow users you know and trust!*

### Regular expressions

If the first line starts with *`#regex`* , the remaining text is sent to a (regexper)[https://regexper.com/] instance that renders a 
railroad diagram for the remaining text - interpreting it as a regular expression - for example this:

```
#regex
/((\d{3})(?:\.|-))?(\d{3})(?:\.|-)(\d{4})/g
```

(enclosed in lines containing ` ```plantuml ` and ` ``` `) would yield the following image in its stead inside gitlab:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18102857/114037796-969ce580-9881-11eb-9ca4-82a7a474f6af.png)

The functionality for rendering the image is self hosted and the system uses a regexper docker container for that, defined inside 
_docker-compose.xml_ for that purpose - at the time, it is not possible to use an external instance for that.

## Error Handling

As with the original PlantUML integration - errors during the rendering process are handled by returning HTTP Status *400* and an image
containing the actual error message produced by the backend. So if the user for example makes a mistake inside a TeX formula - TeXs error message is returned rendered in a PNG image so that Gitlab displays it and the user can correct her mistakes.

## Docker

### Building and running

The included _Dockerfile_ is unbiased concerning the architecture - it is based on [debian:latest](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian). A simple

```
docker-compose build
```

should build the image that can then be started by issuing

```
docker-compose up
```

The application is designed to run inside a docker container. The docker-compose file has preparations to integrate with traefik2.x.

After the container is started, an _index.html_ file with some introduction and background is reachable that allows - among other things - 
to access the Swagger UI GUI for experimenting...

### Configuration

The docker container needs an environment file named _environment.env_ defining Properties as given in the file _environment.example_.

At the moment the application relies on two other servers - one for [Plantuml](https://plantuml.com) and one for [WireViz](https://github.com/formatc1702/WireViz). The configuration for both servers are specified by setting environment variables as can be seen in _environment.example_:

```
PLANTUML_HOST=plantuml.docker.lab
PLANTUML_PORT=80
PLANTUML_URL=png
WIREVIZ_HOST=wireviz.docker.lab
WIREVIZ_PORT=80
WIREVIZ_URL=wsgi/png
```

There is no additional configuration item for the Gnuplot renderer. The TeX renderer can be configured with the target resolution in dots per inch (DPI). The default value for this is `150` as can be seen in _environment.example_:

```
TEX_DPI=150
```

As a rule of thumb: the larger this value is, the larger the generated images are.
